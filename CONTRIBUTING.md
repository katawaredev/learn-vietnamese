## Code Quality

- Code: Follow KISS principle. Donâ€™t settle for "it works" - make it clear, lean, and maintainable.
- Comments: Explain why, not what. Code should be self-documenting. Use comments only to clarify intent, domain rules, or non-obvious details (e.g. magic numbers). Avoid redundant or decorative comments.
